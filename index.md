### New Project Plan: 
* Create a chatbot that will help train counselors by emulating someone who is depressed. Stretch goal is to give the counselor an evaluation of how well they did and possibly how they can improve. Dataset is still the same.

### Approach and Experiment Explanation:
* For our strawman we will use twitter and or reddit data until DAIC becomes available.
* We take tweets that both were tagged with a depression related hashtag (#depression, #mentalhealth, #anxiety, etc.) a negative sentiment and use an trigram model to emulate those tweets (https://github.com/AshwanthRamji/Depression-Sentiment-Analysis-with-Twitter-Data).
* This will have similar output to our chatbot.
* We acknowledge that this is not the best dataset to use. We have submitted requests for access to other datasets in addition to DAIC and are optimistic that at least one one of them will become available to us.

### Example Results:
* rt @alyciatyre : my heart goes out to those of us whose anxiety has gone from crippling to an accelerating vomit / shit / deathlike ever since ‚Ä¶
* depression , but i don't wish them upon anybody .
* t üòÇ üòÇ üòã by alot of using their minds üòÇ üòÇ
* i have depression " just because i'm thinking of something more important to me feeling so tired and sick lately i haven't been able to go in @checkpointorg ' s kami dvorakova ‚Ä¶
* post 1am depression twitter https://t.co/ibmpn4kn8l
* rt @kbelliard_ : nothing hurts more than depression , they're not thinking about life , you know what's really fun about bipolar disorder - anxiety is acting so badly rn lmao
* rt @playstationau : 24 hours to go to a therapist every month and always have panic attacks and anxiety https://t.co/gmhp3ldode
* my parents feel like there's something missing and that's why my depression ? https://t.co/tg3oxxndgl
* talkin bout cancer üò© üò© üò© üò© üò© üò© üò© üò© üò©
* i don't wanna talk until tomorrow üé∂

### Evaluation Framework:
* For now we will simply see if the chatbot sounds naturally depressed
* When we get full counseling data we can also evaluate the chatbot‚Äôs responses to the user based on sentiment analysis.
* We can also use an established sentiment dictionary to evaluate how negative the chatbot is

### Evaluation of results:
* Even with a simple n-gram model the tweets are pretty believable. There are a few nonsensical sections but overall most of them probably wouldn‚Äôt be distinguishable from regular tweets of this nature. The next step is to use reddit data which will be more grammatical so the n gram may not work as well.

### Minimal Action Plan:
* Our final goal will be to produce a chatbot that will have a brief conversation with a user and determine what issues they are facing. To reach that point, we will stick to the following plan:
* Reach out to Tim Althoff to touch base about his research and receive input about our project (as well as potential ethical concerns/questions)
* Using the data provided the crisis line, train a LSTM model that can use helpline conversations to predict what issues the caller is facing
* Do an analysis of our results to determine what questions are the most significant in predicting what issues callers are facing
* Based off the analysis and existing medical questionnaires, train a model that uses the answers to previous questions to ask a question from a pool of hard-coded and predetermined questions that will best help determine what issue the caller is experiencing.

### Stretch Goals:
* Develop a chatbot for depression detection
* Move beyond diagnostics and attempt to apply therapeutic techniques
* Train a more sophisticated model that will help ask good leading questions that will help predict what issues the callers are facing (potentially using GPT-2)

### Motivation:
* Mental health is a major problem that needs to be addressed. We are making strides in improving accessibility to treatment and quality of care, but there simply isn‚Äôt enough manpower available to address the needs of everyone who needs mental health care. An automated preliminary screening for people dealing with mental health crises that can identify what problems people are dealing with would greatly reduce the workload help lines have, and will allow them to quickly point people to issue-specific resources they might need.

### Project Objectives:
* Be able to detect symptoms of depressions based on a user‚Äôs speech
* Create a chatbot that will facilitate conversation and determine best course of action

### Proposed Methodologies:
* Train on Crisis Text Line data for issue differentiation using different embeddings and out of the box models.
* Make a model for determining what questions to ask based on the conversation.
* Create the chatbot that will dynamically ask questions and categorize crisis issues

### Evaluation Plan
For evaluating our first model that simply attempts to classify which issues a user is facing given a conversation, we can stick to standard metrics for classification quality (precision, recall, etc.)
In Tim Althoff‚Äôs paper ‚ÄúLarge-scale Analysis of Counseling Conversations: An Application of Natural Language Processing to Mental Health‚Äù, he provides various methodologies that are useful in quantifying the efficacy of various counseling sessions and conversations. We could potentially leverage these techniques when moving to our goal to ask questions to the user, as it‚Äôs important to verify that our bot is not causing any harm.

### Citizenship NLU:

#### Pros: 
* Denise has already looked into the project so we would be able to receive support from  her. 
* Could potentially be useful to a large population of users, and clearly has real-life stakes.

#### Cons: 
* Target users might have a hard time typing responses and using technology in general
* Might not have time to implement speech to text

#### Codebase: 
* Denise starter code,  https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/R13-1006.pdf (Standford Named Entity Recognition)

### Sarcasm: abandoned.

### Refined Sentiment Analysis down to Psychotherapy Chatbot: 
* Have a conversation with a user that serves a preliminary screening for depression

#### Pros: 
* Mental illness is not well studied in NLP and there are lots of unexplored paths we could take in this project. 
* Mental health is a serious problem, and there are often systematic barriers for access to mental health care, so a project like this would have real stakes and could do a lot of good if it is successful.

#### Cons: 
* Lack of data (due to the sensitive nature of counseling conversations). 
* Costs of failure are very high, as the chatbots will be interacting with sensitive and vulnerable people - saying the wrong thing could significantly worsen users‚Äô mental health.

#### Codebase: 
* https://www.isca-speech.org/archive/Interspeech_2018/abstracts/2522.html (LTSM model)

### Project Ideas:

#### Citizenship NLU:
* Experiment with or replicate relevant models
* Look at starter code and existing applications
* Look at test and find user experiences for preparing for citizenship test
* Create or find data set with citizen test questions and answers
* Start with text input
* Give advice on how to answer better
* Stretch goal: Add support for a voice to text interface. Set up a 1-800 number that people can call and interact with, and add in language detection if there is time to allow us to direct callers to resources in their language if they don't know English.

#### Sarcasm:
* Replication study
* https://towardsdatascience.com/sarcasm-detection-with-nlp-cbff1723f69a
* https://github.com/anebz/papers#sarcasm-detection (linked in article, summary of literature on sarcasm detection)
* Examine existing models for sarcasm detection to get sense of state of the art performance
* Find dataset with labeled texts for input into model
* Determine which medium we want to examine and what context to provide (for instance if we‚Äôre looking at tweets, can we encode information about earlier replies in the chain, earlier user behaviors, and so on)
* Train model that ideally classifies texts on whether they contain sarcasm or not, compare results to state of the art/existing results
* Stretch goals include finding ways to extend existing models to encode relevant information that may be encapsulated in other models/with other information. This is vaguely nebulous at the moment but would hopefully become more clear the more we work on the project as we determine what is lacking. Perhaps some sort of regimented error analysis could be useful for this purpose.

#### Sentiment detection:
* Replication study of existing models for detecting emotion/mood of sentences
* https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0169260715000620
* https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Chetashri_Bhadane/publication/277564782_Sentiment_Analysis_Measuring_Opinions/links/55e5863508aebdc0f589e12e.pdf
* Experiment with ways to capture sentiment in embeddings. Focus on detecting emotional states such as depression.
* Find datasets for how to answer or respond based on mood. Stretch goal is depression chatbot
* Train model on responding to emotional states (stretch goal)
