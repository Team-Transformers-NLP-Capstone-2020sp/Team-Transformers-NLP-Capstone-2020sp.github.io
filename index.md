### Citizenship NLU:

#### Pros: 
* Denise has already looked into the project so we would be able to receive support from  her. 
* Could potentially be useful to a large population of users, and clearly has real-life stakes.

#### Cons: 
* Target users might have a hard time typing responses and using technology in general
* Might not have time to implement speech to text

#### Codebase: 
* Denise starter code,  https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/R13-1006.pdf (Standford Named Entity Recognition)

### Sarcasm: abandoned.

### Refined Sentiment Analysis down to Psychotherapy Chatbot: 
* Have a conversation with a user that serves a preliminary screening for depression

#### Pros: 
* Mental illness is not well studied in NLP and there are lots of unexplored paths we could take in this project. 
* Mental health is a serious problem, and there are often systematic barriers for access to mental health care, so a project like this would have real stakes and could do a lot of good if it is successful.

#### Cons: 
* Lack of data (due to the sensitive nature of counseling conversations). 
* Costs of failure are very high, as the chatbots will be interacting with sensitive and vulnerable people - saying the wrong thing could significantly worsen users’ mental health.

#### Codebase: 
* https://www.isca-speech.org/archive/Interspeech_2018/abstracts/2522.html (LTSM model)

### Topics in Lecture: 
* GPT-2, knowledge extraction, Guest lectures from researchers across the field, Word Embeddings, Sentiment Analysis

### Project Ideas:

#### Citizenship NLU:
* Experiment with or replicate relevant models
* Look at starter code and existing applications
* Look at test and find user experiences for preparing for citizenship test
* Create or find data set with citizen test questions and answers
* Start with text input
* Give advice on how to answer better
* Stretch goal: Add support for a voice to text interface. Set up a 1-800 number that people can call and interact with, and add in language detection if there is time to allow us to direct callers to resources in their language if they don't know English.

#### Sarcasm:
* Replication study
* https://towardsdatascience.com/sarcasm-detection-with-nlp-cbff1723f69a
* https://github.com/anebz/papers#sarcasm-detection (linked in article, summary of literature on sarcasm detection)
* Examine existing models for sarcasm detection to get sense of state of the art performance
* Find dataset with labeled texts for input into model
* Determine which medium we want to examine and what context to provide (for instance if we’re looking at tweets, can we encode information about earlier replies in the chain, earlier user behaviors, and so on)
* Train model that ideally classifies texts on whether they contain sarcasm or not, compare results to state of the art/existing results
* Stretch goals include finding ways to extend existing models to encode relevant information that may be encapsulated in other models/with other information. This is vaguely nebulous at the moment but would hopefully become more clear the more we work on the project as we determine what is lacking. Perhaps some sort of regimented error analysis could be useful for this purpose.

#### Sentiment detection:
* Replication study of existing models for detecting emotion/mood of sentences
* https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0169260715000620
* https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Chetashri_Bhadane/publication/277564782_Sentiment_Analysis_Measuring_Opinions/links/55e5863508aebdc0f589e12e.pdf
* Experiment with ways to capture sentiment in embeddings. Focus on detecting emotional states such as depression.
* Find datasets for how to answer or respond based on mood. Stretch goal is depression chatbot
* Train model on responding to emotional states (stretch goal)
